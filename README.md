# Classical Machine Learning Analysis of Diabetes

This repository contains a reanalysis of the impact of HbA1c measurement on hospital readmission rates using a wide variety of classical machine learning algorithms. This project is built on a subset of the original dataset studied in [B. Strack, J. P. DeShazo, C. Gennings, J. L. Olmo, S. Ven- tura, K. J. Cios, and J. N. Clore, Impact of HbA1c measurement on hospital readmission rates: Analysis of 70,000 clinical database patient records, BioMed Research International 2014, 781670 (2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24804245/). The analysis involves data preparation, feature selection, and model training and evaluation. 

## Repository Contents

- `src/`: contains `data_factory.ipynb` & `analysis.ipynb` which are the main notebooks for data preparation and analysis, respectively.
- `Report.pdf`: contains the final report of the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: contains the required packages to run the notebooks.
